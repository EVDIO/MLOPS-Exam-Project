# MLOPS-Exam-Project
Repository for the exam project for the DTU MLOps course


# Project description

1. __Overall goal of the project__

Following the intention of the Kaggle competition, we aim to build a system capable of classifying unreliable news articles. 
	
2. __What framework are you going to use (PyTorch Image Models, Transformer, Pytorch-Geometrics)__

We plan on using the Huggingface Transformer framework.

3. __How to you intend to include the framework into your project__

We will be using a pre-trained model included in the framework. 

4. __What data are you going to run on (initially, may change)__

The data is made available through the competition. This dataset contains the following features for each news article: A unique ID, the title, the author, the textual content, and finally a binary label of 0 or 1 corresponding to “reliable” and unreliable respectively. The model will be trained using DTU HPC. 

5. __What deep learning models do you expect to use__

We expect to use a transformer model made for Natural Language Processing - specifically a pre-trained BERT.
